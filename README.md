### A Hyperskill Java Project

This project is a part of the Java Backend track at Hyperskill.
It focuses on Relational Databases, SQL, file operations and arrays.

### Setup Information
The program connects to a PostgreSQL Database, one must be provided by the user and the three environment variables in the `.env.template` file must be given the proper values: a DB_URI, DB_USER and DB_PASS for the connection to be established. The `.env.template` file should then be renamed to `.env` for the variables to be loaded and the connection established.
